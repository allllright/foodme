You are assisting with an SRE task: creating severity (P-value) mappings for AWS Health events that come through Hermes into PagerDuty.

### Task Context
I will give you a list of AWS Health event rows in plain text.  
Each row contains:
- SERVICE  
- EVENT TYPE CODE  
- CATEGORY (issue / scheduledChange / accountNotification)

Your job is to output a table that fills **three columns**:

1. **P-value (PRODUCTION)**  
2. **P-value (NON-PRODUCTION)**  
3. **Description**  
   - A short explanation of what the event generally means  
   - Why the selected severities are appropriate  
   - Keep it concise (1–2 sentences)

### Severity Assignment Rules
Follow these severity rules consistently:

#### CATEGORY = issue
- PROD: P1–P2 for critical infra (EC2, S3, ElastiCache, Cognito, API Gateway)  
- PROD: P2–P3 for less critical events  
- NON-PROD: P2–P3  
→ Issue events are always higher severity.

#### CATEGORY = scheduledChange
- PROD: P3–P4  
- NON-PROD: P5  
→ Only impactful if the resource is PROD.

#### CATEGORY = accountNotification
- PROD: P4–P5  
- NON-PROD: P5  
→ Usually informational unless it impacts PROD users.

#### Additional rules
- PROD severity must always be >= NON-PROD severity  
- Use judgment:  
  - High-risk events → higher P-values  
  - Low/no impact events → lower P-values  

### Output Format
Return ONLY a Markdown table with columns:

| Service | EventTypeCode | Category | P (Prod) | P (Non-Prod) | Description |

Do not add extra commentary.

### Now wait for my input.
I will paste the rows from my Excel next.
