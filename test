Great — now we’ll draft Section 2: How Predictive Auto-Scaling Works.

Your goals are:

keep it concise,

avoid too many subsections,

maintain a clean SRE documentation style,

use only essential insights from your Deep Research report.

Below is a polished, Confluence-ready version that aligns with your Table of Contents.

2. How Predictive Auto-Scaling Works

2.1 Concept

Predictive Auto-Scaling analyses historical CloudWatch metrics to learn recurring load patterns and forecast future demand.
AWS generates a 48-hour, hour-by-hour forecast, refreshed every 6 hours, based on the strongest recurring signals it detects in the metric data.

The Auto Scaling Group (ASG) then adjusts desired capacity ahead of time, ensuring new instances finish initialization and warm-up before the predicted peak.
Forecasts and the resulting “predicted capacity” are visible in CloudWatch under the ASG’s predictive scaling graphs.

AWS models require at least 24 hours of metric history to begin forecasting, with two or more weeks of stable historical data providing the most reliable patterns. The model can learn any recurring periodicity (daily, weekly, multi-day cycles) as long as it consistently appears in the data.

2.2 Key Metrics

Predictive scaling relies on two distinct types of metrics:

Load Metric
Represents total workload demand (e.g., ALBRequestCountPerTarget, sum of CPU).
This is what the ML model forecasts.

Scaling Metric
A per-instance utilization metric (e.g., ASGAverageCPUUtilization).
This is used to convert the forecast into required instance count.

Target Utilization
The desired average utilization for each instance (e.g., 50–60%).
AWS computes:
Inferred Required Capacity = Forecasted Load / Target Utilization

Forecasted load, predicted capacity, and inferred required capacity appear in CloudWatch as part of the predictive scaling visualization.

2.3 Modes of Operation

Forecast-Only Mode
Predictive scaling generates load and capacity forecasts but does not modify the ASG capacity. This mode is recommended for initial evaluation.

Forecast + Scale Mode
The ASG adjusts desired capacity at the start of each hour to match the predicted capacity. A launch buffer can be configured to ensure instances complete warm-up early.

Interaction with Target Tracking
Predictive scaling only performs scale-out.
Scale-in always relies on target-tracking or step scaling policies, which respond to real-time metrics.
When multiple policies exist, the ASG applies the maximum recommended desired capacity to maintain availability.

If you'd like, I can now proceed to Section 3: Comparison with Existing Scaling Strategies, keeping it concise and fully aligned with your lightweight Confluence style.
